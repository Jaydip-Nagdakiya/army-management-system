## How to Run the Project (Local Setup)

This project is a PHP & MySQL based web application and is designed to run on a local server environment such as XAMPP.

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP (Apache & MySQL)
- Web browser (Chrome / Edge)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Steps to Run

1. *Download or Clone the Project*
   - Download ZIP from GitHub  
     OR  
   - Clone using Git:
     
     git clone https://github.com/Jaydip-Nagadakiya/army-management-system.git
     

2. *Move Project to XAMPP Directory*
   - Copy the project folder
   - Paste it inside:
     
     C:\xampp\htdocs\
     
   - Folder path should look like:
     
     C:\xampp\htdocs\army_management_system
     

3. *Start XAMPP Server*
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Start *Apache*
   - Start *MySQL*

4. *Import Database*
   - Open browser and go to:
     
     http://localhost/phpmyadmin
     
   - Create a new database (e.g. army_management_system)
   - Import the SQL file from:
     
     /Database/
     

5. *Configure Database Connection*
   - Open:
     
     includes/db_connect.php
     
   - Update database credentials if required:
     php
     $host = "localhost";
     $user = "root";
     $password = "";
     $database = "army_management_system";
     

6. *Run the Project*
   - Open browser and visit:
     
     http://localhost/army_management_system/

## 🔑 Demo Login Credentials

### 👨‍💼 Admin (Demo)

- Email: admin@test.com
- Password: admin@123

> ⚠️ *Note:*  
> Soldier credentials are NOT fixed and are generated by the Admin panel.

---

## 🔁 User Access Flow

### Admin
- Admin logs in using demo credentials.
- Admin registers soldiers through the Admin panel.
- Soldier login credentials are generated and sent via email.

### Soldier
- Public self-registration is disabled.
- Soldier can log in only after receiving credentials from Admin.

This design ensures *controlled access and higher security*, which is suitable for military-style systems.

---

## 🔐 OTP & Email Functionality (Important)

This project includes OTP-based email verification for:
- Forgot Password
- Soldier Registration

### Demo Limitation:
- OTP emails work *only on systems where SMTP/sendmail is configured*.
- On external systems (e.g., HR laptop), OTP emails may not be received.

> This behavior is expected and demonstrates how the system would work in a production environment with proper email configuration.

---

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

- Password hashing using PHP password_hash()
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection
- Role-based access restriction
- No personal email or credentials exposed in the repository
- Dummy/demo credentials used for GitHub showcase
