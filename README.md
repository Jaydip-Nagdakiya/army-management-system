## 🔁 User Access Flow

### Admin
- Admin logs in using demo credentials.
- Admin registers soldiers through the Admin panel.
- Soldier login credentials are generated and sent via email.

### Soldier
- Public self-registration is disabled.
- Soldier can log in only after receiving credentials from Admin.

This design ensures *controlled access and higher security*, which is suitable for military-style systems.

## 🔐 OTP & Email Functionality (Important)

This project includes OTP-based email verification for:
- Forgot Password
- Soldier Registration

### Demo Limitation:
- OTP emails work *only on systems where SMTP/sendmail is configured*.
- On external systems (e.g., HR laptop), OTP emails may not be received.

> This behavior is expected and demonstrates how the system would work in a production environment with proper email configuration.

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

- Password hashing using PHP password_hash()
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection
- Role-based access restriction
- No personal email or credentials exposed in the repository
- Dummy/demo credentials used for GitHub showcase
